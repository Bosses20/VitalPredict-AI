## Key Success Metrics

Track these metrics daily:
1. **Daily new waitlist signups** (target: 100+/week)
2. **Traffic by source** (goal: identify 2-3 scalable channels)
3. **Conversion rate by channel** (benchmark: 5%+ from visit to signup)
4. **Engagement rate** on content (comments, shares, saves)
5. **Cost per waitlist signup** (target: under $3)

## Contingency Plans

**If Reddit posts get removed:**
- Reframe as questions rather than promotional content
- Engage more in comments before posting your own content
- Consider Reddit ads as alternative ($5-10/day)

**If Facebook group engagement is low:**
- Shift strategy to direct outreach to group members
- Test different message framing (fear vs. solution vs. scientific)
- Consider partnering with group admins

**If ad costs are too high:**
- Focus exclusively on organic channels
- Double down on micro-influencer partnerships
- Create more sharable content to generate organic reach

## Daily Check-in Questions

Review these questions at the end of each day:
1. Which channel brought the most quality signups today?
2. What messaging resonated most strongly in comments/feedback?
3. What objections or concerns are we seeing from the community?
4. Are we on track to hit our weekly targets?
5. What one change could we make tomorrow to improve results?
