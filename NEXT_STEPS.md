## 3. Google Analytics Integration (Pending post-deployment)

Google Analytics code integration has been completed and is ready for configuration post-deployment.
- The necessary code for tracking page views and events has been implemented
- A test page has been created at `/admin/test-analytics` to verify the configuration
- Documentation has been added in `docs/ANALYTICS_SETUP_GUIDE.md`

**Steps to Complete After Deployment:**
1. Create a Google Analytics 4 account and property
2. Enter your actual domain URL for the data stream
3. Get your Measurement ID (starts with G-)
4. Add your Measurement ID to the production environment variables as `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID`
5. Verify the integration is working using the test page

## 4. Deploy Your Website

### Steps to Complete:
- [ ] Create a Vercel account at [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
- [ ] Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
- [ ] Configure your environment variables in the Vercel dashboard:
